CTRL + V in normal mode changes to visual block mode.
Visual block mode allows you to change multiple lines after hitting SHIFT + I

//This is a multi line test!
//This is a multi line test!
//This is a multi line test!
//This is a multi line test!


In visual block mode you can also use C to change selected text.

//This is a multi lines test!
//This is a multi lines test!
//This is a multi lines test!
//This is a multi lines test!



If you want to search for a specific string you can use / from normal mode.
The search will automatically put your curser on the first find of the string.
You can step through the results by pressing N to advance forward and SHIFT + N to go back.

//search for slashsearch
//this is also an instance of slashsearch
//slashsearch is cool!

You can change all matches by first going in to command mode (:).
Then using %s/[string to find]/[replacement for string]/g.


//edit this string: phill
//it works here too!: phill
//even down here: phill


You can also change a string only on the line you have selected by dropping the %

//edit this string: bob
//it wont work here phill
//or down here: phill


Multi line indents can be done by hitting V, then arrow down or up to select the text you want, then hitting <Shift> >
You can also put a number before > to indicate by how many tabs you want over (v <Down> 2 <Shift> >)

  Indent me more!
  Indent me more!
  Indent me more!
