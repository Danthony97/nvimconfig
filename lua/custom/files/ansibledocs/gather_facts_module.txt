Synopsis¶

    the default is to use the setup module.

-   This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful
    variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks.

-   It can also be executed directly by /usr/bin/ansible to check what
    variables are available to a host.

-   Ansible provides many facts about the system, automatically.

Notes¶

Note

-   This module is mostly a wrapper around other fact gathering modules.

-   Options passed to this module must be supported by all the
    underlying fact modules configured.

-   Facts returned by each module will be merged, conflicts will favor
    ‘last merged’. Order is not guaranteed, when doing parallel
    gathering on multiple modules.

Examples¶

    # Display facts from all hosts and store them indexed by I(hostname) at C(/tmp/facts).
    # ansible all -m gather_facts --tree /tmp/facts

Status¶

-   This module is not guaranteed to have a backwards compatible
    interface. [preview]

-   This module is maintained by the Ansible Core Team. [core]
