Lookups

Lookup plugins retrieve data from outside sources such as files,
databases, key/value stores, APIs, and other services. Like all
templating, lookups execute and are evaluated on the Ansible control
machine. Ansible makes the data returned by a lookup plugin available
using the standard templating system. Before Ansible 2.5, lookups were
mostly used indirectly in with_<lookup> constructs for looping. Starting
with Ansible 2.5, lookups are used more explicitly as part of Jinja2
expressions fed into the loop keyword.

Using lookups in variables

You can populate variables using lookups. Ansible evaluates the value
each time it is executed in a task (or template).

    vars:
      motd_value: "{{ lookup('file', '/etc/motd') }}"
    tasks:
      - debug:
          msg: "motd value is {{ motd_value }}"

For more details and a list of lookup plugins in ansible-core, see
Working with plugins. You may also find lookup plugins in collections.
You can review a list of lookup plugins installed on your control
machine with the command ansible-doc -l -t lookup.
