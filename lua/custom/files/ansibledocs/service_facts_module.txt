Synopsis¶

-   Return service state information as fact data for various service
    management utilities

Requirements¶

The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

-   Any of the following supported init systems: systemd, sysv, upstart

Notes¶

Note

-   When accessing the ansible_facts.services facts collected by this
    module, it is recommended to not use “dot notation” because services
    can have a - character in their name which would result in invalid
    “dot notation”, such as ansible_facts.services.zuul-gateway. It is
    instead recommended to using the string value of the service name as
    the key in order to obtain the fact data value like
    ansible_facts.services['zuul-gateway']

Examples¶

    - name: Populate service facts
      service_facts:

    - debug:
        var: ansible_facts.services

Returned Facts¶

Facts returned by this module are added/updated in the hostvars host
facts and can be referenced by name just like any other host fact. They
do not need to be registered in order to use them.
