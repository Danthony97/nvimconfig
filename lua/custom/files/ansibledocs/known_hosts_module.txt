Synopsis¶

-   The known_hosts module lets you add or remove a host keys from the
    known_hosts file.

-   Starting at Ansible 2.2, multiple entries per host are allowed, but
    only one for each key type supported by ssh. This is useful if
    you’re going to want to use the git module over ssh, for example.

-   If you have a very large number of host keys to manage, you will
    find the template module more useful.
