Synopsis¶

-   Executes a low-down and dirty SSH command, not going through the
    module subsystem.

-   This is useful and should only be done in a few cases. A common case
    is installing python on a system without python installed by
    default. Another is speaking to any devices such as routers that do
    not have any Python installed. In any other case, using the shell or
    command module is much more appropriate.

-   Arguments given to raw are run directly through the configured
    remote shell.

-   Standard output, error output and return code are returned when
    available.

-   There is no change handler support for this module.

-   This module does not require python on the remote system, much like
    the script module.

-   This module is also supported for Windows targets.

Notes¶

Note

-   If using raw from a playbook, you may need to disable fact gathering
    using gather_facts: no if you’re using raw to bootstrap python onto
    the machine.

-   If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be
    better to use the command or shell modules instead.

-   The environment keyword does not work with raw normally, it requires
    a shell which means it only works if executable is set or using the
    module with privilege escalation (become).

-   This module is also supported for Windows targets.

Examples¶

    - name: Bootstrap a host without python2 installed
      raw: dnf install -y python2 python2-dnf libselinux-python

    - name: Run a command that uses non-posix shell-isms (in this example /bin/sh doesn't handle redirection and wildcards together but bash does)
      raw: cat < /tmp/*txt
      args:
        executable: /bin/bash

    - name: Safely use templated variables. Always use quote filter to avoid injection issues.
      raw: "{{ package_mgr|quote }} {{ pkg_flags|quote }} install {{ python|quote }}"

    - name: List user accounts on a Windows system
      raw: Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_UserAccount
