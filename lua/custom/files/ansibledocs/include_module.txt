Synopsis¶

-   Includes a file with a list of plays or tasks to be executed in the
    current playbook.

-   Files with a list of plays can only be included at the top level.
    Lists of tasks can only be included where tasks normally run (in
    play).

-   Before Ansible 2.0, all includes were ‘static’ and were executed
    when the play was compiled.

-   Static includes are not subject to most directives. For example,
    loops or conditionals are applied instead to each inherited task.

-   Since Ansible 2.0, task includes are dynamic and behave more like
    real tasks. This means they can be looped, skipped and use variables
    from any source. Ansible tries to auto detect this, but you can use
    the static directive (which was added in Ansible 2.1) to bypass
    autodetection.

-   This module is also supported for Windows targets.

Notes¶

Note

-   This is a core feature of Ansible, rather than a module, and cannot
    be overridden like a module.

-   Include has some unintuitive behaviours depending on if it is
    running in a static or dynamic in play or in playbook context, in an
    effort to clarify behaviours we are moving to a new set modules
    (include_tasks, include_role, import_playbook, import_tasks) that
    have well established and clear behaviours.

-   This module will still be supported for some time but we are looking
    at deprecating it in the near future.
