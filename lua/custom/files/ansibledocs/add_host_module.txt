Notes¶

Note

-   This module bypasses the play host loop and only runs once for all
    the hosts in the play, if you need it to iterate use a with-loop
    construct.

-   The alias host of the parameter name is only available on Ansible
    2.4 and newer.

-   Since Ansible 2.4, the inventory_dir variable is now set to None
    instead of the ‘global inventory source’, because you can now have
    multiple sources. An example was added that shows how to partially
    restore the previous behaviour.

-   Windows targets are supported by this module.

Examples¶

    - name: Add host to group 'just_created' with variable foo=42
      add_host:
        name: '{{ ip_from_ec2 }}'
        groups: just_created
        foo: 42

    - name: Add host to multiple groups
      add_host:
        hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
        groups:
        - group1
        - group2

    - name: Add a host with a non-standard port local to your machines
      add_host:
        name: '{{ new_ip }}:{{ new_port }}'

    - name: Add a host alias that we reach through a tunnel (Ansible 1.9 and older)
      add_host:
        hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
        ansible_ssh_host: '{{ inventory_hostname }}'
        ansible_ssh_port: '{{ new_port }}'

    - name: Add a host alias that we reach through a tunnel (Ansible 2.0 and newer)
      add_host:
        hostname: '{{ new_ip }}'
        ansible_host: '{{ inventory_hostname }}'
        ansible_port: '{{ new_port }}'

    - name: Ensure inventory vars are set to the same value as the inventory_hostname has (close to pre Ansible 2.4 behaviour)
      add_host:
        hostname: charlie
        inventory_dir: '{{ inventory_dir }}'
